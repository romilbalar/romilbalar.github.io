Hi,

thank you for downloading. Have fun and tell your friends about us ;)

CSS
----------

The theme stylesheet is css/style.default.css. If you want to make any changes, you can do it here or better to override it in custom.css so you can update the original theme stylesheet if an updated is released.

Javascript
----------

Apart from Bootstrap JS components and jquery.onepage-scroll majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. Onepage scrolling is activated for screen widths > 1000px, if you want to change it, do so in front.js.
